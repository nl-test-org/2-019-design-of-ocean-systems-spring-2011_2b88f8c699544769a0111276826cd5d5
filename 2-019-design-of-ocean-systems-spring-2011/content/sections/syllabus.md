Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Labs: 1 session / week, 3 hours / session

Prerequisites
-------------

_Mechanics and Materials I (_[_2.001_](/courses/2-001-mechanics-materials-i-fall-2006)_)_, _Dynamics and Control I (_[_2.003J_](/courses/2-003j-dynamics-and-control-i-fall-2007)_)_, _Thermal-Fluids Engineering I (2.005)_ or _Hydrodynamics (_[_2.016_](/courses/2-016-hydrodynamics-13-012-fall-2005)_)_.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

The main learning objectives of the course are:

*   Understanding and application of basic principles in hydrodynamics, dynamics, and structural mechanics in the design of ships and offshore structures
*   Understanding the design spiral for ships and offshore structures
*   Becoming familiar with the use of key design tools in naval architecture and marine engineering
*   Understanding the key issues and trade-off principles
*   Understanding sea-keeping characteristics and implications
*   Understanding issues in station keeping and mooring line design
*   Becoming familiar with general procedures and issues in fabrication, manufacture, and installation
*   Developing effective communication and presentation skills for the final report

References
----------

There is no required textbook for this class, but several references are recommended. Lecture notes also provide the key reading material. The readings were supplemented by select articles on specific topics, especially on the design of floating offshore structures.

The following three texts are particularly suggested as references:

Coursework
----------

Coursework consists primarily of a three-part term-length Design Project and three homework assignments, all designed to help students better comprehend the basic concepts taught in class. The goal is also to prepare the students for the use of the various pieces of software needed for the Design Project. The Design Project is to be completed in team with each individual responsible for the report and discussion of a separate subject; homework is to be done individually.

### Homework

In the first homework, the students conceptualize their design by doing preliminary calculations and drawing sketches of different ship views and internal subdivisions. For example, they calculate the positions of the collision bulkheads, the size of the tanks, the height of the double bottom, etc. Next, they realize this concept in the PARAMARINE™ environment, calculating major geometric particulars such as coefficients of form and preliminary hydrostatic characteristics.

The second homework is a structural analysis of a generic ship. From the framework of building a ship that can withstand the maximum allowable working stress, students calculate the total load on the ship, shear forces, bending moments, plate thickness, and the dimensions of the midship section structural elements.

The third homework is an introduction to the panel method of sea-keeping analysis. The students use WAMIT® to calculate the added mass and wave damping coefficients as well as wave excitation and RAOs for a floating vertical circular cylinder. The purpose of this homework is to become familiar with the use of WAMIT for sea-keeping analysis.
